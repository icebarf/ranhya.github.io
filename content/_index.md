This is a site that I don’t expect many people to read, it’s mostly just for me to keep track of what video games I’ve played and my thoughts on them—just in a public manner because why not. I’ll try to keep it updated as much as possible because I don’t want to be another person with a “blog” that only has like two posts lol.

You can find a list of games I’ve completed [right here](/meta/completion/) I will update it as soon as I complete another game and all that. It also contains links to videos of completion progress or posts relating to the games.

If you like the site you can message me on discord  **@ranhya** and tell me what you think about it! I’m not really on any other social media.
