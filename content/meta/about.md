This is a site that I donâ€™t expect many people to read, itâ€™s really only for me to have an outlet to where I can write about anything I want (mostly video games lol), it feels futile to write and not share it with people so I made this site to do that. Iâ€™ll try to keep it updated as much as possible because I donâ€™t want to be another person with a blog that only has like two posts lol.

You can find a list of games Iâ€™ve completed [right here](/meta/completion/) I will update it as soon as I complete another game and all that. It also contains links to videos of completion progress or posts relating to the games.


If you like the site you can message me on discord  **@ranhya** and tell me what you think about it! Iâ€™m not really on any other social media.
