- Blog

This is where the main blog posts sit—all of them related to gaming in one way or another.
- Meta

For meta posts, aka posts about the site itself and or about me. Just a general category for stuff that I deem fit for it lol.
- Offtopic

I’m not sure about this category name yet. Anyways it’s just anything not related to gaming. Be it anime, TV shows or anything else I decide to write about, it will be here most likely.
