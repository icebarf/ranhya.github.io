## It's just awesome
Sifu is one of the best games I’ve ever played. It’s just genius, the way everything is put together it feels like a game made with so much love and passion.  The game feels like it was made by people who love martial arts and video games, the mechanics feel so good—the moves are straight up amazing. The Bak Mei inspired style that Sifu uses is insanely cool. The flow of the combat is super addictive and all of that on top of an AWESOME art style you’ve got yourself the most badass game I’ve ever played.
