Elden Ring is by far the biggest game FromSoft has made to date and it is also my favorite as of writing this post.

I think it has every aspect I loved about the other souls games I played but by like boosted like 10 times. I think, these games are at heart, Metroidvanias and Elden Ring feels most like one. The open world and literally do anything whenever you want nature of the game make this game feel way more like a Metroidvania than the others.

There’s so much to do and see that you could do many playthroughs without even seeing certain areas that other players ended up seeing at the very beginning or other stuff like that. That gives the game a lot of replay-ability along with the amount of build variety you can have, you can just play the game for thousands of hours casually and still not get bored.

There are like over 130 bosses in the base game which is insane—and most of them are good bosses too, very fun fights. 

## The Open World
The Elden Ring open world is absolutely massive, I don’t believe the 79 square kilometer estimate is very accurate but it works see: [this video](https://youtu.be/XWQtJiQ1Sm4). But compared to other games the map is absolutely massive and the amount of stuff there is to do in the open world is insane. There’s still so many areas in the open world that I haven’t seen probably which is crazy.

The main way you traverse this massive open world is obviously, with your trusty steed, Torrent. Torrent moves way faster than your character does but to be honest he does feel a bit slow at times, the travel time between graces and certain close areas feels kind of annoying.

An example of that is the way to the Academy Glintstone Key from South Raya Lucaria Gate is deceptively long.

Though travel times aren’t really that big of a deal the main thing that sucks when exploring the open world is

**THAT YOU CAN NEVER OPEN YOUR MAP WHEN YOU NEED TO**

It is so infuriating when you’re looking for an item or a dungeon or something and you just cannot open your map to check where the fuck you are because some random enemy 3000 meters away is still aggroed onto you, it is so bad. I don’t know what FromSoft was thinking when they made you unable to open the map in combat. Worse decision they’ve ever made. You could argue that it’s to prevent you from fast traveling when in combat but they could’ve just disabled fast travel in combat and that would’ve been a better way to deal with it.

## Gameplay
The gameplay loop in Elden Ring is a lot different than the other games FromSoft has made, in my opinion. The core of it is still the same, explore, kill bosses, find key items, get an ending.

But the gameplay loop in Elden Ring focuses a lot more on exploration than the other games, obviously with such a massive open world it’s not a surprise that the game is very focused on exploration—but it’s not just the fact that the game has an open world, the game also has A LOT of dungeons to explore. Not just legacy dungeons but optional dungeons which you will spend a lot of time exploring.

This is also where the Metroidvania aspect of the game comes in, with so much to explore, on subsequent play-throughs the most fun part of the game is coming up with a build, going to the places, getting the weapons and the items and all of that. Upgrading your weapons and trying to optimize your build is very fun. I am a big fan of routing so it’s pretty cool.
### The NPC Quests
So, I wanna talk about the NPC quests a bit since I think Elden Ring improves *a lot* on them, compared to the other games completing the NPC quests is a lot easier without any sort of guide.

There’s not a lot that will lock you out of certain NPC quests and it is a lot more obvious what you’re supposed to do in them. In general you’d ignore quests in these games but in this game specifically I think they’re worth at least trying to do as they’re not too complicated.

Ranni’s quest is the most important quest in the game as certain areas are locked behind it essentially so doing it is imperative, plus you get a cool ending if you do it. The game does an ok job of making it obvious that Ranni is an important character for the most part since you see her right at the start of the game.
