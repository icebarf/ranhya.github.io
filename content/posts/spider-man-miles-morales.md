Truly one of the games of all time.

For real this game isn’t really the best. It’s not a bad game by any means it was fun enough to play and to [platimum]() but it was short and kept missing on like so many aspects. I played the other Spider-Man game a while back and it was MILES (haha get it?) better than this.
