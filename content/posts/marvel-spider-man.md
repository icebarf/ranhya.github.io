I can tell why this game is a fan favorite on the PS4, and also a must-play for a lot of people. I usually wouldn't play this kind of game, I'm not a big fan of superheroes. However I bought this game a long time ago to play with my nephew and I finally got around to [platinuming]() it (year) years later.

If you own a PS4 (or even if you don't!) I definitely recommend giving this one a shot.

## Story

The story is not super special but there's enough substance here that it serves for a good bit of entertainment. It's not super deep and it's pretty easy to guess where the story is going up until a certain point. 

[WIP]

## Combat

The combat is the star of this game I do believe. The combat feels smooth and there's a lot of cool stuff you can do to absolutely shit on the enemies. One of my favorite things to do is to do the wall attack where you just jump on a wall and then attack—it looks really cool and feels really cool to do.

The combat encounters are varied enough that it doesn't become stale as new enemy types start showing up as you progress to the game. The environments feel good to fight in with lots of different options for approaching the fight, be it stealth or guns blazing just beat the shit out of everyone. 

You can drop scaffolding on enemies which will instantly kill them no matter what type of enemy they are, you can also lay trap mines... or just stick them to the enemies and watch them get stuck to a wall.

The gadgets you get are all very nice to use and you get to use them quite a lot. I think the star of the show is the [you know the one I forgot the name] gadget which is very powerful and will help you instantly kill a lot of enemies as webbing enemies to walls or the floor will instantly take them out of the fight. No matter the type of enemy.

The web bomb is also fun because a lot of the time you'll be overwhelmed by groups of enemies and you can absolutely just destroy them with one of these bad boys. If you're lucky you'll even stick a few of them to the wall which is very nice.

In general even on the hardest difficulty the game is fair and the enemies have a fair amount of health (unlike another game... iykyk).

Perfect dodging is super duper satisfying and also very rewarding which is good. Though it's not super duper hard to pull off. I can pull it off pretty much every time now which is very nice.

Though I will say some of the enemies have really annoying patterns... well I say some but it's just the fat guys—those guys will just keep doing attacks over and over again; they just do attack after attack after attack all. And it has gotten me killed more times than I'd like to admit. I don't think it's bad design per se but it is definitely weird and annoying especially when fighting groups of enemies you don't really get an opening to attack the other enemies because of the fat guys.

That's what makes perfect dodge so good though as it will incapacitate them for a little bit which allows you to maybe get one of the other enemies in the air, after which you're free to do whatever you want as the enemies can't do shit while you're in the air. The only exception to this are the enemies with guns, which are very powerful... they do __a lot__ of damage. Snipers are definitely the worst and the enemies I usually end up taking down first as if you don't do it you'll just get one shot by them basically. That's where stealth comes into play I guess you're supposed to stealth takedown the snipers before fighting.
