I can tell why this game is a fan favorite on the PS4, and also a must-play for a lot of people. I usually wouldn't play this kind of game, I'm not a big fan of superheroes. However I bought this game a long time ago to play with my nephew and I finally got around to [platinuming]() it (year) years later.

If you own a PS4 (even if you don't!) I definitely recommend giving this one a shot.
