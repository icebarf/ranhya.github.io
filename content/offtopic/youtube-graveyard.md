So I came across this YouTube video today: [Exploring “0-view YouTube” Until I Get a Bingo](https://youtu.be/zYmkOInF6Us?si=A6NLh1WETPq-cwiG)

It reminded me of the fact that I’ve always enjoyed getting glimpses or exploring this part of the internet—by that I mean, randomly coming across some of this random videos with no views whatsoever. Or scrolling through random people’s Reddit profiles, especially those with a long post history.

I just think it’s super interesting to get a small glimpse into someone else’s life, it’s nice to think about how others might live sometimes. There’s like this mystique, you get to speculate and wonder what their struggles might be. If it’s in an old video or post, you might wonder what they’re up to now, or even if they’re still here with us…

I think this is also part of why I find blogs so interesting. They’re a place where people are willingly sharing parts of they want to with others and it ends up immortalized for decades. Finding old blogs is always a treat—new blogs too.

After watching that video I ended up trying to use the method he used to find the videos as well. It actually worked and I had a pretty fun time scrolling through these old and new videos that all seemed so random without any context to why they were even uploaded in the first place. Some are pretty obvious—events and gatherings people want to remember. Others weren’t, especially the ones in languages I couldn’t understand… I think I even ended up finding an ad for a school in Uzbekistan or something lol.

You can also try it, refer to the image below to see what you need to search in order to find these videos.
