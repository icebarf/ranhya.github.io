Dragon Rot
In theory it is a cool mechanic that would impact the way you play—if it actually did anything impactful that is. Unfortunately the Dragon Rot mechanic does absolutely nothing it has only once prevented me from doing something in the game—but by that time I was in NG&#43;3 and had enough of the items to get rid of it and continue as normal."

    <p>I love Sekiro and it is as of the time I’m writing this my favorite FromSoft game. However, while they nailed pretty much everything else I feel like there’s a few pointless mechanics in the game that bug me. I think the most popular one known for being absolutely pointless is the Dragon Rot mechanic.</p>
<h2 id="dragon-rot">Dragon Rot</h2>
<p>In theory it is a cool mechanic that would impact the way you play—if it actually did anything impactful that is. Unfortunately the Dragon Rot mechanic does absolutely nothing it has only once prevented me from doing something in the game—but by that time I was in NG+3 and had enough of the items to get rid of it and continue as normal.</p>
<p>I don’t think it was super thought out. In general merchants and other NPCs don’t do much of anything, so Dragon Rot literally doesn’t change the game other than make the sculptor cough when you go see him—you can still use his services though…</p>
<p>Nobody actually dies from it and the items you need to clear it are rare and are also valuable because they give you extra revives so using them to clear dragon rot is pretty stupid unless you need to do it to do a story-line—which again I only had to do once.</p>
<h2 id="exp-and-unseen-aid">EXP and Unseen Aid</h2>
<p>The EXP mechanics SUCK in Sekiro. The skill trees and scrolls are awesome, but the way the EXP system works I think is pointlessly complicated.</p>
<p>When you die you lose 50% of your experience (and sen), you cannot however lose levels/skill points when you die, you will only lose 50% of your experience for the current level you are at. My main gripe with this is that it doesn’t actually hurt you in any way it just wastes your time if you are trying to get all the skills. There’s no good reason to take away half of your EXP on death, even though it’s not super punishing or whatever it adds a lot of unnecessary farming when you want to get all of the skills.</p>
<p>I think I farmed EXP for a few hours in order to get all of the skills—which is required for the platinum achievement.</p>
<h3 id="unseen-aid">Unseen Aid</h3>
<p>Unseen Aid is probably the most pointless mechanic in this game. It ties in with the Dragon Rot mechanic.</p>
<p>When you die you have a chance to not lose 50% of your EXP and Sen. That’s it. The chance is 30% by default but, it can be changed by dragon rot.</p>
<ul>
<li>Owning one Rot Essence decreases the percentage of Unseen Aid to 15%.</li>
<li>Each subsequent Rot Essence decreases Unseen Aid chance by 2%</li>
<li>Unseen Aid chance can go down to no lower than 2%.</li>
<li>Healing Dragon Rot increases the percentage back to the default of 30%; see the Dragon Rot page for details.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that it cannot be increased past 30% so it’s basically useless.</p>
<p>Yeah that’s it. Dragon deez nuts on yo face.</p>
