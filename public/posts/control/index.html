    <p>Control is an amazing game with an amazing atmosphere. While a little short I think it suits it well, and after playing it about 2 weeks ago as of writing this… I think it’s become one of my favorite games I’ve played so far!</p>
<p>You play as Jesse Faden, in search of her brother who was taken away by the FBC (Federal Bureau of Control)… which is basically the SCP foundation.</p>
<p>The gameplay in control is something akin to a metroidvania, just more linear than a game you’d traditionally call a metroidvania. The game while mostly story focused has someo side content, especially with the two DLCs—that being said it’s still quite short. I’ve heard of people finishing the game in like 9 hours. I got the <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=-ZqxTEynWDY">plat</a> in about 19. Finished both the DLCs in 21 I think.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things about the game is actually a specific area—one you visit a couple times throughout the game: <strong>The Ocean View Motel and Casino.</strong></p>
<p><img src="/images/The_Ocean_View_Motel_and_Casino.jpeg" alt="The Ocean View Motel"></p>
<p>It’s a liminal space. In the plot it is used as a sort of security measure by the Bureau. It is just so <em>vibey</em> I absolutely love it. You don’t spend a lot of time in the area throughout the game—obviously since it is a liminal space. But every time I got to go there I would get so excited lol.</p>
