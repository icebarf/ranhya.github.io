Control is an amazing game with an amazing atmosphere. While a little short I think it suits it well, and after playing it… I think it’s become one of my favorite games I’ve played so far!
You play as Jesse Faden, in search of her brother who was taken away by the FBC (Federal Bureau of Control)… which is basically the SCP foundation.
Gameplay
The gameplay in control is something akin to a metroidvania, just more linear than a game you’d traditionally call a metroidvania. The game while mostly story focused has quite a lot of side content as well, especially with the two DLCs—that being said it’s still quite short. I’ve heard of people finishing the game in like 9 hours. I got the plat in about 19. Finished both the DLCs in 21 I think."

Control is an amazing game with an amazing atmosphere. While a little short I think it suits it well, and after playing it… I think it’s become one of my favorite games I’ve played so far!</p>
<p>You play as Jesse Faden, in search of her brother who was taken away by the FBC (Federal Bureau of Control)… which is basically the SCP foundation.</p>
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p>The gameplay in control is something akin to a metroidvania, just more linear than a game you’d traditionally call a metroidvania. The game while mostly story focused has quite a lot of side content as well, especially with the two DLCs—that being said it’s still quite short. I’ve heard of people finishing the game in like 9 hours. I got the <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=-ZqxTEynWDY">plat</a> in about 19. Finished both the DLCs in 21 I think.</p>
<h3 id="gun-play-and-abilities">Gun-play and abilities</h3>
<p>The gun play feels great with quite a few weapons to choose from all very useful for a bunch of different situations. My favorite of them has to be the one introduced in the AWE expansion: Surge.</p>
<p>It shoots grenades that stick to enemies and the ground and you can detonate them at any time you want it’s just a lot of fun.</p>
<p>The abilities you get are also a lot of fun. You get a bunch throughout the game that play into the Metroidvania aspect—where you find yourself being able to access new areas as you unlock more abilities… a dash—ground pound, all of that good stuff. I won’t say more because I do think it’s kind of a spoiler but look forward to them if you do play the game.</p>
<h2 id="story-and-environments">Story and Environments</h2>
<p>The story of the game is great and it keeps you on your toes and wondering, Jesse becomes the director of the bureau after picking up the gun from Trench at the start of the game and the story revolves around her figuring out the bureau’s secrets and finding her brother while working to stop the “hiss.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the game is top-tier, it really feels like you just entered the SCP foundation, it‘s dark enough to be vibey but not too dark that it feels gloomy to me. I always hate it when it’s always dark and gloomy without any kind of break from the darkness but control doesn’t have that issue! It definitely feels scary without it being overly dark.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things about the game is actually a specific area—one you visit a couple times throughout the game: <strong>The Ocean View Motel and Casino.</strong></p>
<p><img src="/images/The_Ocean_View_Motel_and_Casino.jpeg" alt="The Ocean View Motel"></p>
<p>It’s a liminal space. In the plot it is used as a sort of security measure by the Bureau. It is just so <em>vibey</em> I absolutely love it. You don’t spend a lot of time in the area throughout the game—obviously since it is a liminal space. But every time I got to go there I would get so excited lol.</p>
<h3 id="jesse-faden">Jesse Faden</h3>
<p>Jesse is the main character of the game obviously, I wanna talk about her a bit because I think she’s cool. She’s very well written and very autism-coded. She’s not overly cautious when she doesn’t need to be and is trusting of people which is great—it makes the atmosphere feel less odd when you know she likes a person.</p>

Her monologuing and talking to Polaris is also super welcome and I love her thought process. She feels like a very well written main character that fits the role of director very well :D</h1>
