Peak gaming. Cat Quest is a game I remember from when I was a little girl—and seeing it on sale for super cheap I nabbed it. It was a great decision. I remembered this game very fondly and I’m glad to report that it is not nostalgia this game slaps.
The gameplay loop is addictive and keeps you playing, I played it for 10 hours and got the platinum, couldn’t put the game down for those 10 hours."

Peak gaming. Cat Quest is a game I remember from when I was a little girl—and seeing it on sale for super cheap I nabbed it. It was a great decision. I remembered this game very fondly and I’m glad to report that it is not nostalgia this game slaps.</p>
<p>The gameplay loop is addictive and keeps you playing, I played it for 10 hours and got the <a href="https://youtu.be/y6QPlokR4M4">platinum</a>, couldn’t put the game down for those 10 hours.</p>
<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>The combat system is incredibly polished and the movement attacking and using spells all feel very good. It’s very satisfying killing groups of enemies and collecting EXP and coins dropped from enemies forces my brain to literally ooze dopamine from my pores it’s just that good.</p>
<p>The spells are very thought out thought a lot of them are outshined by 3 spells specifically. You can get every spell after beating the first main boss in the game (dragon) which is cool. Though the most useful ones so heavily outshine the other ones that I ended up using 3 spells nearing the end off the game… and was melting bosses way above my own level, skull icon and all.</p>
<p>The game isn’t super difficult obviously, it doesn’t need to be. But it provides enough of a challenge to keep you engaged and the combat loop is super fun. Repetitive? Yes but the game is short enough that I never once got bored of just killing things. Even just grinding felt fun.</p>
<p>I really love the spells and I think they’re super cool because of the way they work. You have 5 damage spells available to you: fire, ice, lighting, trap and a purple magic idk what it is lol. The thing I really like about them is that they all have different patterns they hit in! Lighting hits to the sides of your character while ice hits in the front and in the back, fire is a big AOE circle and the purple magic thing hits in an X shape. The trap magic is special as it leaves a spike trap behind that lasts a few seconds and hurts the enemies that stand on it.</p>
<p>Other than those you have a healing spell which becomes less and less useful as you become more powerful and, the most broken ability in the game—an ability that gives you a percentage boost to your damage, all of it. At max level I think it’s like an 100% boost and it is BROKEN. It only consumes a sliver of your mana so you can spam it in every encounter and absolutely melt every enemy with lighting and fire spells (they deal the most damage)</p>
