Uncharted 1 is a game that had potential—it’s not perfect but it was good enough; so it got a sequel and the series was born, I think idfk.
Platinum Experience
Uncharted 1 starts you off right in the action—and that’s indicative of the whole game. Having now beaten the game on Crushing (legit) and acquired the platinum. I have to say, while the game has its flaws, I had a lot of fun doing it!"

Uncharted 1 is a game that had potential—it’s not perfect but it was good enough; so it got a sequel and the series was born, I think idfk.</p>
<h2 id="platinum-experience">Platinum Experience</h2>
<p>Uncharted 1 starts you off right in the action—and that’s indicative of the whole game. Having now beaten the game on Crushing (legit) and acquired the <a href="https://youtu.be/wnW1rw-geFU">platinum</a>. I have to say, while the game has its flaws, I had a lot of fun doing it!</p>
<p>The main gripe I have with the game, is that there is a LOT of shooting—compared to Uncharted 4.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The lots of fighting got pretty boring on my first play-through, however—with the absolutely insane difficulty of crushing, I thought it wasn’t <em>as bad</em>. Weird… I know, but I found it very rewarding (and frustrating :D) to finally get through a tough encounter some of which took dozens of tries and strategies.</p>
<p>And the amount of encounters did allow for that, but while I thought it a plus during my crushing play-thorough, I do have to say the difficulty and amount of encounters could definitely get quite stale—</p>
<p>You die in like three shots;
The enemies practically have aim bot, so using the in-game cover system means you have very little time to peak out of cover before you get shot to death—and couple that with whatever the fuck kinda drugs the enemies are taking to literally <strong>dodge your shots</strong> matrix-style… the game can feel super duper punishing and unfair a lot of the time… a lot of my deaths I felt like I had no chance because the enemies just lasered me out of nowhere—it definitely felt like RNG at times whether or not I would die in a section.</p>
<p>That’s only on crushing difficulty though—hard and below are quite fair I think.</p>
<p>I am currently trying to platinum the Nathan Drake Collection, so I have to do Uncharted 2 and 3 next. However I think I might also do a brutal run (probably just going to cheat though) for the collection trophy that requires you to beat the game on brutal.</p>
<h2 id="the-gun-play">The gun-play</h2>
<p>The gun play is overall very satisfying even if it’s a little lacking in terms of… feedback? It’s still very satisfying to hit headshots and the guns don’t feel too bad. Out of all of the weapons the pistols are by far the best feeling and, also probably the strongest, with the shotgun being in second. The rifles, are just way too unwieldy and only really good for blind fire, and even then they’re outclassed by the shotguns in that area as well. So in reality there’s only like 3 guns that are worth using in the whole game</p>
<ul>
<li>All of the pistols besides the submachine gun</li>
<li>The sniper</li>
<li>The shotguns</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-collectible-system">The collectible system</h2>
<p>Pretty lacking in my opinion, there are 61 treasures in total, and the way they are placed around the game is pretty boring… you end up getting a lot in the first few chapters and then they’re spread out pretty thin throughout the whole game after that. Most of them are not very far off the beaten path and all you do is walk up to them and pick them up. There’s also certain areas with like 3 or 4 treasures close to each other so they get very heavily penalized for proximity. That being said they’re not the worst, and you can totally miss them it’s not like they’re in plain sight.</p>

<h2 id="the-story">The Story</h2>
<h3 id="spoilers-ahead-dont-read-if-you-dont-want-to-be-spoiled-i-guess"><strong>Spoilers ahead! Don’t read if you don’t want to be spoiled I guess.</strong></h3>
<p>Uncharted 1’s story, is nothing special but I think it is pretty good for the first game in the series.</p>
<p>You have two(three) big bad guys, one bigger and badder than the other, and one bigger and badder than both the others.</p>
<p>You defeat all of them—kinda… (RIP Eddy). I think the big reveal near the end with the treasure was awesome, especially the set-piece with Eddy, though it is a shame to see him die—he was one of the bad guys. I would’ve loved to see him and Nate fight the big bad guy together, I think it would’ve been an awesome ending—because they probably shared a hatred for Roman and the other guy at the end… maybe not enemies to friends… but enemies to allies—would’ve been awesome.</p>
<p>Elena is awesome and I hope to see more of her in 2 and 3, Elena in 4 was also awesome so…</p>
<p>Yeah that’s all my thoughts. Bye!</p>
