The Blacklist is an interesting show, it’s right up my alley, and has done quite well to the point that other shows seem to have taken from it. (I say this because I have a feeling the J-Drama Invisible (インビジブル) might have taken inspiration from it as they have an identical premise)
This post will just be a collection of my thoughts on the show, therefore it will contain lots of spoilers. So if you don’t want that I recommend you do watch the show first as it is actually a really good show!"

The Blacklist is an interesting show, it’s right up my alley, and has done quite well to the point that other shows seem to have taken from it. (I say this because I have a feeling the J-Drama Invisible (インビジブル) might have taken inspiration from it as they have an identical premise)</p>
<p>This post will just be a collection of my thoughts on the show, therefore <strong><mark style=“color:red;”>it will contain lots of spoilers</mark></strong>. So if you don’t want that I recommend you do watch the show first as it is actually a really good show!</p>
<p>I will update the post with my thoughts as I keep watching.</p>
<h2 id="season-1">Season 1</h2>
<p>Season 1 is merely an introduction that sets the story in motion it seems. The main plot in season 1 revolves around Red giving the task force a bunch of targets whom are seemingly disconnected but at the end we find out that they are all actually connected to the entity we now know as Berlin.</p>
<p>The thing Liz is really annoying in season 1 at times being butthurt over crazy things. And it’s clear from the start that Tom is weird. One thing about Tom is that I can’t see him as Tom Keen and instead in my head he’s Max Fosh from New Amsterdam which makes no sense in this story because he is a horrible criminal who’s done horrible things lol.</p>
<p><em>also my prediction is that Liz will end up with Ressler they’ve been setting this up, Aubrey getting killed off was what made it clear to me. Though I don’t know whether or not it’s gonna happen yet obviously… I give it a 9/10 chance</em></p>
<h2 id="season-2">Season 2</h2>
<p>The start of the season focuses on finding Berlin and Liz coming to terms with what has happened to her—with Tom and with her father.</p>
<p>I think it’s quite a shame that Malik died I quite liked her character but Samar seems to be her replacement I guess, colored woman must replace other colored woman of course (lol). Samar is cool though I like her character so far.</p>
<p>Liz’s character arc continues as well, now she’s paranoid, sleeping in motels, using aliases… sleeping with a gun. She’s kind of a badass though.</p>
<p>Naomi/Carla is a fucking bitch along with her stupid ass husband, your life is in danger but you refuse to listen to the one guy who can keep you safe, it’s so fucking stupid dude what the hell. Like I guess that it’s a complicated past and stuff but that shouldn’t matter when your life is in danger and you know that Red only wants to help you fucking stay alive.</p>
<p>I mean the only reason she got grabbed in the first place was because she was being a stubborn motherfucker, if you are in protective custody and the FBI comes to tell you that you are in danger you go with them NO QUESTIONS ASKED it’s kinda stupid that she just stood there talking like bruh go already.</p>
